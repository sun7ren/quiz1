    <h1> All About My Hometown </h1>
    <p> Though I was born in Serang, Indonesia- I resonate more with calling Al Ruways, Abu Dhabi, my hometown. It's a city I remember more of
        since I've lived there since I was three. It witnessed my firsts and lasts. First day of kindergarden, First fall from learning the bicycle, 
        Last day of highschool, Last day of ever living with my parents for a period of my life. </p>

     <h1>Motto(s): A city of life, leisure, and opportunities.</h1>
        <p> From what was formally called "Al Ruwais", the city I grew up in has changed its name to Al Dhannah (Arabic: الظنة). Al Dhannah is a city located 240 km (150 mi) west of Abu Dhabi City, in the Western Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
                The Al Dhannah/Ruwais industrial and housing complex has been developed by ADNOC as a major contributor 
                to the national economy and represents a series of multimillion-dollar investments by the company. Once a small fishing headland from which a handful of people scratched a seasonal living, Al Dhannah today is one of the most modern industrial complexes in the Middle East. </p>
